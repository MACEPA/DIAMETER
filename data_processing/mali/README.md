# Mali data processing

Code for compiling different Mali datasets (treatment, demographics, analyte results) into one dataset, as well as fixing weird date
issues across the different datasets, is in the data_processing.py file. Code for classifying the points, as well as visualinzing
patients, is in the data_viz.py file. Helper functions for visualization are in the data_viz_helpers.py file.
